Just a little bit of inspiration I saw from a youtuber. 

I tried selenium before and the chrome browser died after the first second. 

Apparently the driver needs to meet the chrome version. 

So the solution was to use a driver manager. 

Got it working on 3-4 sites. 

But after countless testing of trying to scrap 92 clubs, instagram gave me a capticha code. I think it thought i was a robot of some kind, which this program is, like an automation. 

But there are two versions you can run. 
test.selenium.py and naturally 2 tries to scrape the 92 clubs information. Like followers, how many posts.. We have put in a little wait of a minute. 

But my first proper go of programming in a long time. I have tried youtube summarisers and creating images of Ai, that takes on my poor CPU.
